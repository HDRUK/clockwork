# Clockwork Vagrant Virtual Machine

IMPORTANT: vagrant was originally used to develop clockwork. It is now
recommended to use multipass instead. If you are reading this, you probably want
to look inside the multipass directory of this repository instead.

This is for developers to create a VM to develop the code and run the
tests. Assumes you have vagrant installed.

Please see the [instructions here](https://github.com/iqbal-lab-org/clockwork/wiki/Information-for-developers).
