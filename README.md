# Clockwork 
## Pipelines for processing bacterial sequence data (Illumina only)  and variant calling

Note: these pipelines were developed for the [CRyPTIC](http://www.crypticproject.org/) project which studies M. tuberculosis, but in principle can be used on any bacteria.

Please see the [clockwork wiki page](https://github.com/iqbal-lab-org/clockwork/wiki) for documentation.
